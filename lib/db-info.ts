/**
 * Database Information
 *
 * Currently, this application uses in-memory storage (localStorage) for demonstration purposes.
 *
 * For a production environment, you would want to implement a proper database. Here are some options:
 *
 * 1. SQL Databases:
 *    - PostgreSQL (recommended for complex data relationships)
 *    - MySQL
 *    - SQLite (for smaller applications)
 *
 * 2. NoSQL Databases:
 *    - MongoDB (document-based, good for flexible schemas)
 *    - Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities)
 *    - Firebase Firestore (serverless, good for rapid development)
 *
 * 3. Serverless Options:
 *    - Vercel KV (Redis-compatible key-value store)
 *    - Vercel Postgres (serverless PostgreSQL)
 *    - PlanetScale (serverless MySQL)
 *
 * Implementation Steps:
 * 1. Choose a database provider
 * 2. Set up connection in a database client file
 * 3. Replace localStorage operations with database operations
 * 4. Add proper error handling and connection pooling
 * 5. Implement migrations for schema changes
 *
 * For this application, PostgreSQL or MongoDB would be good choices
 * as they can handle document storage and relationships well.
